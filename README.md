## Some examples of work projects

###  Tiktok Data preparation for Machine Learning Model - Course based [(Link)](https://github.com/FernandoAlves92/Portfolio/blob/bd8ef2c1ddadd6f69a961868a4625c6a0aa14a3e/Activity_Course%202%20TikTok%20project%20lab%20(1).md)
- **Background:** TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner.
TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
- **Goal:** Is to construct a dataframe in Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform TikTok data team members of your findings.
- **Results:** I identified some correlations between Claims and Opinions classifications and presented statistical analysis to the team (more on the link). This will accelerate the development of a Machine Learning that can predict which submitions are likely to be Claims or Opinions, helping Tiktok to manage review subissions in a timely manner. 

###  AI Advisory platform
- **Background:** ATB Financial had implemented an AI tool aimed at providing suggestions to client-facing team members about topics to discuss with clients. The client base emcompassed more than 90,000 small business onwers. These advice suggestions were derived from client data, including transactional history and profile information. This customization enabled tailoring advice based on predicted client situations and product needs. However, a significant adoption challenge emerged. Team members showed reluctance in utilizing the tool, leading to missed sales and advisory opportunities. This, in turn, affected potential revenue growth and the overall client experience.
- **Goal:** My team and I embarked on a mission to comprehend the underlying barriers hampering widespread adoption. Our objectives encompassed the creation of new Machine Learning (ML) models and collaborating with the data team to enhance model refinement through increased feedback channels.
- **Results:** By conducting interviews and delivering group training, we successfully identified and mitigated the obstacles impeding team members from adopting the tool. Concurrently, we established regular meetings with the data team, facilitating the documentation and development of over 15 new ML models. Additionally, we devised a feedback process that stimulated model refinement through team member training. The culmination of these efforts yielded resounding success.

  The AI advisory tool emerged as the biggest revenue-generating platform by supporting team members during sales interactions and ensuring timely product offerings to clients. This achievement underscored the           
  transformative potential of data-driven solutions in optimizing sales and enhancing client satisfaction.

###  Client Retention Machine Learning Model
- **Background:** ATB Financial confronted the challenge of retaining a segment of its small business client base, especially as they advanced to more accelerated growth stages. Despite conducting exit client interviews, the precise reasons behind the majority of departing clients remained elusive, largely limited to psychological factors (such as perceived superiority of competitors or occasional service hiccups).
- **Goal:**  My team and I embarked on a mission to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting clients who might consider shifting to competitors. This would allow us the opportunity to engage with them before they executed the move.
- **Results:**  I spearheaded the complete development lifecycle of the "Churn" ML model, collaborating closely with our AI team. This encompassed defining the data triggers indicative of a client's intent to migrate to a competitor, selecting relevant factors for integration into the ML model, and ultimately launching the model within the AI platform. The process extended to training team members on effectively initiating conversations with clients and providing feedback to fine-tune the model.

  As a result of these endeavors, we proactively engaged with 7-10% of the client base, resulting in a notable reduction in churn rate. Additionally, the model's insights unveiled that clients predominantly departed due     to concerns related to our product offerings. Armed with this information, I presented to our product team, highlighting the misalignment of our product lineup with market demands. This revelation substantiated our        subsequent efforts in product rationalization, leading us to review and optimize all banking offers based on prevailing market requirements. This comprehensive approach helped align our products more effectively with      the dynamic needs of our clientele.

###  Sales leads pipeline
- **Background:** Among my initial undertakings at ATB Financial in Data Analytics and Strategy, I embarked on the creation of a Financial Milestone map. This innovative map was designed to pinpoint the business growth stage of clients based on their financial transaction data. The insights derived from this map enabled us to offer proactive guidance to clients, thus elevating their satisfaction scores. Intriguingly, a deeper exploration revealed that the Financial Milestones map held the potential to bolster our marketing and sales endeavors.
- **Goal:** The principal objective was to harness the transaction data of our clients to develop strategic sales opportunities. Moreover, I aimed to explore potential additional data points that could contribute to the construction of a robust sales pipeline, ultimately augmenting revenue generation.
- **Results:** I successfully constructed a financial model within our database, focusing on clients whose account balance accounted for less than 20% of their monthly free cash flow. This designation indicated clients with restricted available cash, possibly necessitating injections of capital or financial products to address the shortfall. I overlaid this dataset with information about clients who visited the ATB Financial website and exhibited engagement with loan-related pages.

  Leveraging the conjunction of these two key data points – identifying clients in need of cash and displaying interest in loan products – I formulated a targeted sales pipeline. This pipeline was disseminated to our   
  sales team members, empowering them to establish connections and proactively engage with clients to ascertain their business well-being. The outcome was remarkable: a notable 37% surge in phone sales conversion rates 
  ensued as a result of these initiatives. This demonstrated the tangible impact of leveraging data insights to enhance client engagement and drive revenue growth.

###  Business Advisory Dashboard
- **Background:** One of ATB's major overarching objective revolved around providing business clients with custom-tailored advice that aligns with their unique situations and business lifecycles. This impetus led to the establishment of a novel department tasked with devising innovative products and tools to elevate the quality of advice extended to the client base.
- **Goal:** My primary aim was to collaborate closely with the newly formed Advisory department. Together, we embarked on the mission of conceptualizing, testing, and  developing the dashboard. Plus training team members to proficiently navigate it. This dashboard was meticulously designed to present data insights to team members, thereby empowering them to engage in meaningful conversations with clients.
- **Results:** While implementing the dashboard and training team members less familiar with data insights posed significant challenges, we were able to develop innovative solutions. Through insightful interviews, utilization of the Financial Milestone Map, and leveraging in-depth comprehension of client needs combined with data modeling expertise, we achieved a remarkable feat. Over 50 team members were adeptly trained in using the dashboard. This training not only elevated their financial and data literacy levels but also equipped them to deliver proactive advice that resonated profoundly with each client's distinct business context. This project showcased how bridging data and advisory expertise can enhance client engagement and empower informed decision-making.
